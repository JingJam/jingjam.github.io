## Description
Charlie Hebdo has always been using Comedy and Cartoons as **WMD - Weapons of Mass Drollery**. Unfortunately a few narrow-minded individuals feel genuinely more threatened by humor than conventional weapons. 

**Everybody \[BLANK\] Charlie** is setting you as a young person working for the newspaper, who takes a break 30 minutes before the events of that fateful day. What will happen?
