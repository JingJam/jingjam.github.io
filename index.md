##I'm a Game Dev based in Beijing, what should I do?

The easiest way would be to get access to [this repository](https://github.com/JingJam/jingjam.github.io.git).
Send me via Wechat (my ID is xrosee) or [email](xrosee@live.cn) your [GitHub](http://github.com) ID and I'll add you to the **JingJam** organization.

###And writing a post?
Once you've cloned the repo on your hard drive, point your terminal to the folder you downloaded it (to the root of the folder) and type

    rake post title="your title"

It will create a `your-title.md` file in the `_posts` folder and prepopulate all the YAML info for you.

Then you can type in your article using your favorite text editor.

###Once it's finished, what should I do?

Commit and push.
And that's it
